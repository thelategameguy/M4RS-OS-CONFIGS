# M4RS-OS-CONFIGS
The configs/dotfiles repository for my WIP upcoming Linux distro M4RS-OS


This repo will include things such as:
1. The M4RS-OS automated insalation tool
2. Defalut Config and dotfiles for things like hyprland, waybar, etc.
3. Built-in screenshaders for additional SSSTYLE
4. Explinations of how each entry works and how it peices together.

Note: Right now, M4RS-OS is internal use only and in the pre-alpha phase, A full ISO will not be released until sometime Febuary 2026. 

Stay tuned :3
